    <p>Lamas are amazing animals. When they get mad at you becasuse you won't share your popcorn they spit at you. They also
        mean mug you if your telling secrets and they can't hear what you're saying.
    </p>
    <p>Lama's have very long necks. Having a long neck, allows lamas to be more aerodynamic while trotting through open fields.
        Don't every call a lama by its first name, they hate that. They do love a good episode of glee though. Never loan a lama
        money either, because they will never pay you back. Its against their code of ethics. In a lamas culture it shows weakness
        to pay a debt.
